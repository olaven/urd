# URD - üïô/:spiral_calendar: 

URD is a tiny iOS-app that allows you to show how many hours you have spent per iCAL-calendar. 
This app is built for me. However, you might find it useful as well! 

I use the calendar on my mac/iPhone to see how I spend my time. It allows me to organize my day, remember appointments, 
and get a general sense of where my time is being spent. Lately, I have experimented with _time tracking_ as well. 
That is, using apps like [Toggl](toggl.com) to essentially start a timer for every task I am doing. This is tedious. 
Especially considering I already manage many calendars (more or less manually) to begin with. 

URD is just a replacement for the time tracking apps, that counts the hours I have spent doing something for each calendar. 


## Features and Feedback 
As this is a small personal project, I will add features when I feel like it. However, if you have any suggestions, I will be 
more than happy if you let me know. 

Currently, my main ideas are: 
- [X] Showing hours spent per calendar
- [ ] Showing hours spent in a given interval (last week, month, year etc.) 
- [ ] Displaying some fitting diagram with hours/calendar 
- [ ] Change the order of displayed calendars
- [ ] Sorting alphabetically and by hours 
- [ ] Manual refresh
I am not used to writing in Swift, nor making stuff for iOS in general. Additionally, I have not used SwiftUI that much either. 
Please let me know if you have any feedback on how the code should be (re)written. You are probably right. And in any case, I will 
listen üë®‚Äçüíª

## Requirements
The app is built with [SwiftUI](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui). Running the app thus requires you to 
install iOS 13 beta, as of august 2019. Developing the app requires the Xcode 11 beta. To download these, see [developer.apple.com](developer.apple.com).
